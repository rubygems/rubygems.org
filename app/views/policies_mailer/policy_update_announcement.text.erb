Hello <%= @user.handle %>,

We're reaching out to inform you that RubyGems.org is adopting a Terms of Service [1], Privacy Notice [2], Acceptable Use Policy [3], and Copyright Policy [4]. We announced the review period for these policies in our recent blog post [5]. The review period for these policies will conclude on June 4th. If you have any questions, feedback, or concerns, please reply to this email at legal@rubycentral.org or join the discussion in the #oss-program-ruby-central channel [6] on the Ruby Central Community Slack.

After June 4th, we will display a banner on RubyGems.org prompting users to review and accept the new policies.

Thanks,
RubyGems team
