  <h2>Ruby Central</h2>

  <p>

  <h2>Ruby Together</h2>

  <p>
    Ruby Together is a grassroots initiative committed to supporting the critical Ruby infrastructure you rely on: Bundler, RubyGems, and other shared tools. No more waiting around until someone has free time to apply security patches. Instead, Ruby Together pays developers for dedicated time maintaining and improving shared Ruby tools. Help us keep RubyGems.org running smoothly and free for everyone to use by <a href="https://rubytogether.org/developers?source=rubygems">joining as a developer today</a>.
    <br><br>
    Companies count on robust tools, but the volunteers who maintain critical Ruby infrastructure can't keep up in their free time. All too often, individual companies end up paying full-time engineers to privately work around issues shared by the entire Ruby community. You shouldn't pay full price for private solutions to shared issues. Spend more time building great apps, and less time on the tools that make those apps possible: <%= link_to "join Ruby Together", "https://rubytogether.org/companies?source=rubygems" %>.
