  <h2>Reporting a security issue</h2>

  <p>
    Before continuing, please ensure this is a security issue for the RubyGems
    client or the RubyGems.org service. For all vulnerabilites with individual
    gems, follow our guide on <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/security/#reporting-security-vulnerabilities">
      reporting security issues</a> with others' gems. If it's a security issue
    with the Ruby on Rails framework, see the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/security/">
      Rails Security</a> guide.

  <h2>Disclosure Policy</h2>

  <p>
    RubyGems and RubyGems.org follow a 5 step disclosure policy:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Security report received and is assigned a primary handler. This person
      will coordinate the fix and release process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Problem is confirmed and, a list of all affected versions is determined.
      Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still supported. These fixes
      are not committed to the public repository but rather held locally pending
      the announcement.
    </li>
    <li>
      A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen.
    </li>
    <li>
      On the embargo date, the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubygems-developers">
      rubygems-developers mailing list</a> is sent an announcement. This will
      include patches for all versions still under support. The changes are
      pushed to the public repository and new gems released to rubygems. At
      least 6 hours after the mailing list is notified, a copy of the advisory
      will be published on the <a href="http://blog.rubygems.org/"> RubyGems.org
      blog</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required
    with maintainers of other projects. Every effort will be made to handle
    the bug in as timely a manner as possible, however it’s important that
    we follow the release process above to ensure that the disclosure is
    handled in a consistent manner.
  </p>

  <h2>Receiving Security Updates</h2>

  <p>
    The best way to receive all the security announcements is to subscribe
    to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubygems-developers">
      rubygems-developers mailing list</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    No one outside the core team or the initial reporter will be notified prior
    to the lifting of the embargo. We regret that we cannot make exceptions to
    this policy for high traffic or important sites, as any disclosure beyond
    the minimum required to coordinate a fix could cause an early leak of the
    vulnerability.
  </p>

  <h2>Comments on this Policy</h2>

  <p>
    If you have any suggestions to improve this policy,
    please send an email to <a href="mailto:security@rubygems.org">
      security@rubygems.org</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues">
      open an issue on GitHub</a>. Thanks!
