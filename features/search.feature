Feature: Search
  In order to find a gem I want
  As a ruby developer
  I should be able to search for gems on gemcutter

  Scenario Outline: Search
    Given the following versions exist:
      | rubygem           | description  |
      | name: LDAP        | mail stuff   |
      | name: ldap-plus   | more LDAP    |
      | name: twitter     | social junk  |
      | name: twitter-cli | command line |
      | name: beer_laser  | amazing beer |
    When I go to the homepage
    And I fill in "query" with "<query>"
    And I press "Search"
    Then I should see "search for <query>"
    And I should see "<result>"

    Examples:
      | query      | result       |
      | twitter    | social junk  |
      | beer       | beer_laser   |
      | ldap       | mail stuff   |
      | beer laser | amazing beer |

    Given the following version exists:
      | rubygem              | description |
