h2. Contributions

Gemcutter has a 'commit-bit' policy, much like the Rubinius project. Submit a patch that is accepted, and you can get full commit access to the project. All you have to do is ask us on #gemcutter on Freenode or bug qrush in a message and he'll add you as a collaborator on the main repository. Feel free to fork the project though and have fun in your own sandbox.

Please read up on the "GitHub Wiki":http://wiki.github.com/rubygems/gemcutter/contribution-guidelines for the latest contribution guidelines.

To get setup, please check out the "Development Setup":https://github.com/rubygems/gemcutter/wiki/Development-Setup page on the wiki. It's on the wiki so anyone can edit it, so please fix it if you have trouble getting set up!
