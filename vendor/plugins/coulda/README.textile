h2. Model generator

    $ script/generate model User

* factory (Factory Girl)
* unit test (Shoulda)
* migration
* model

h2. Controller generator

    $ script/generate controller Users new

* functional test (Shoulda & Factory Girl), only test RESTful new action
* controller, only RESTful new action
* no helper file

* We're not sure we like this one yet. Let us know what you think.

h2. Model generator: belongs_to

    $ script/generate model post user:belongs_to

* "add_index" in the migration
* "belongs_to" in the model
* "should_belong_to" in unit test
* association in the factory

<pre><code>class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :posts do |t|
      t.belongs_to :user
      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :posts, :user_id
  end

  def self.down
    remove_index :posts, :user_id
    drop_table :posts
  end
end

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
end

class PostTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  should_belong_to :user
  should_have_index :user_id
end

Factory.define :post do |post|
  post.association(:user)
end</code></pre>

h2. Model generator: paperclip

    $ script/generate model design image:paperclip

* all the necessary columns in the migration
* "has_attached_file" in the model
* "should_have_attached_file" in unit test

<pre><code>class CreateDesigns < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :designs do |t|
      t.string :image_file_name
      t.string :image_content_type
      t.integer :image_file_size
      t.datetime :image_updated_at
      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :designs
  end
end

class Design < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :image
end

class DesignTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  should "be valid with factory" do
    assert_valid Factory.build(:design)
  end
  should_have_attached_file :image
end</code></pre>
