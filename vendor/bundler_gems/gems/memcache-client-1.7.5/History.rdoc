= 1.7.5 (2009-09-09)

* Fix ruby warnings (josh)
* Make megabyte value size limit optional since Tokyo Tyrant can accept values larger than 1MB.
  Use :check_size => false to disable the size check. (jsl)
* Ruby 1.9 support for recent I/O changes.
* Fix duplicate value marshalling on server error. (rajiv)
* Added option :autofix_keys (disabled by default) to replace long keys with md5 hashes (sd)

= 1.7.4 (2009-06-09)

* Fix issue with raising timeout errors.

= 1.7.3 (2009-06-06)

* Remove SystemTimer support, refactor I/O to use nonblocking operations.  Speeds up
  performance approx 100%. Timeouts basically have no overhead now!  (tenderlove)
* Update load logic to support SystemTimer running in Ruby Enterprise Edition.  Thanks
  to splattael on github for the comment.

= 1.7.2 (2009-04-12)

* Rollback socket timeout optimization.  It does not work on all operating systems
  and was a support headache.

= 1.7.1 (2009-03-28)

* Performance optimizations: 
  * Rely on higher performance operating system socket timeouts for low-level socket 
    read/writes where possible, instead of the (slower) SystemTimer or (slowest,
    unreliable) Timeout libraries.
  * the native binary search is back!  The recent performance tuning made the binary search 
    a bottleneck again so it had to return.  It uses RubyInline to compile the native extension and 
    silently falls back to pure Ruby if anything fails.  Make sure you run:
    `gem install RubyInline` if you want ultimate performance.
  * the changes make memcache-client 100% faster than 1.7.0 in my performance test on Ruby 1.8.6: 
    15 sec -> 8 sec.
* Fix several logging issues.

= 1.7.0 (2009-03-08)

* Go through the memcached protocol document and implement any commands not already implemented:
  - cas
  - append
  - prepend
  - replace
  
  Append and prepend only work with raw data since it makes no sense to concatenate two Marshalled
  values together.  The cas functionality should be considered a prototype.  Since I don't have an
  application which uses +cas+, I'm not sure what semantic sugar the API should provide.  Should it
  retry if the value was changed?  Should it massage the returned string into true/false?  Feedback
  would be appreciated.

* Add fetch method which provides a method very similar to ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#fetch,
  basically a wrapper around get and add. (djanowski)

* Implement the flush_all delay parameter, to allow a large memcached farm to be flushed gradually.

* Implement the noreply flag, which tells memcached not to reply in operations which don't
  need a reply, i.e. set/add/delete/flush_all.

* The only known functionality not implemented anymore is the <flags> parameter to the storage
  commands.  This would require modification of the API method signatures.  If someone can come
  up with a clean way to implement it, I would be happy to consider including it.

= 1.6.5 (2009-02-27)

* Change memcache-client to multithreaded by default.  The mutex does not add significant
  overhead and it is far too easy, now that Sinatra, Rails and Merb are all thread-safe, to
  use memcache-client in a thread-unsafe manner.  Remove some unnecessary mutexing and add
  a test to verify heavily multithreaded usage does not act unexpectedly.

* Add optional support for the SystemTimer gem when running on Ruby 1.8.x.  This gem is
  highly recommended - it ensures timeouts actually work and halves the overhead of using
  timeouts.  Using this gem, Ruby 1.8.x is actually faster in my performance tests
  than Ruby 1.9.x.  Just "gem install SystemTimer" and it should be picked up automatically.

= 1.6.4 (2009-02-19)

* Remove native code altogether.  The speedup was only 10% on Ruby 1.8.6 and did not work
  on Ruby 1.9.1.

* Removed memcache_util.rb from the distribution.  If you are using it, please copy the code
  into your own project.  The file will live in the github repository for a few more months
  for this purposes. http://github.com/mperham/memcache-client/raw/7a276089aa3c914e47e3960f9740ac7377204970/lib/memcache_util.rb

* Roll continuum.rb into memcache.rb.  The project is again a single Ruby file, with no dependencies.

= 1.6.3 (2009-02-14)

* Remove gem native extension in preference to RubyInline.  This allows the gem to install
and work on JRuby and Ruby 1.8.5 when the native code fails to compile.

= 1.6.2 (2009-02-04)

* Validate that values are less than one megabyte in size.

* Refactor error handling in get_multi to handle server failures and return what values
  we could successfully retrieve.

* Add optional logging parameter for debugging and tracing.

* First official release since 1.5.0.  Thanks to Eric Hodel for turning over the project to me!
  New project home page: http://github.com/mperham/memcache-client

= 1.6.1 (2009-01-28)

* Add option to disable socket timeout support.  Socket timeout has a significant performance 
  penalty (approx 3x slower than without in Ruby 1.8.6).  You can turn off the timeouts if you 
  need absolute performance, but by default timeouts are enabled. The performance
  penalty is much lower in Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9 and JRuby.  (mperham)

* Add option to disable server failover.  Failover can lead to "split-brain" caches that 
  return stale data. (mperham)

* Implement continuum binary search in native code for performance reasons.  Pure ruby
  is available for platforms like JRuby or Rubinius which can't use C extensions. (mperham)
  
* Fix #add with raw=true (iamaleksey)

= 1.6.0

* Implement a consistent hashing algorithm, as described in libketama.
  This dramatically reduces the cost of adding or removing servers dynamically
  as keys are much more likely to map to the same server.

  Take a scenario where we add a fourth server.  With a naive modulo algorithm, about
  25% of the keys will map to the same server.  In other words, 75% of your memcached
  content suddenly becomes invalid.  With a consistent algorithm, 75% of the keys
  will map to the same server as before - only 25% will be invalidated. (mperham)

* Implement socket timeouts, should fix rare cases of very bad things happening
  in production at 37signals and FiveRuns.  (jseirles)

= 1.5.0.5

* Remove native C CRC32_ITU_T extension in favor of Zlib's crc32 method.
  memcache-client is now pure Ruby again and will work with JRuby and Rubinius.

= 1.5.0.4

* Get test suite working again (packagethief)
* Ruby 1.9 compatiblity fixes (packagethief, mperham)
* Consistently return server responses and check for errors (packagethief)
* Properly calculate CRC in Ruby 1.9 strings (mperham)
* Drop rspec in favor of test/unit, for 1.9 compat (mperham)

= 1.5.0.3 (FiveRuns fork)

* Integrated ITU-T CRC32 operation in native C extension for speed.  Thanks to Justin Balthrop!

= 1.5.0.2 (FiveRuns fork)

* Add support for seamless failover between servers.  If one server connection dies,
the client will retry the operation on another server before giving up.

* Merge Will Bryant's socket retry patch.
http://willbryant.net/software/2007/12/21/ruby-memcache-client-reconnect-and-retry

= 1.5.0.1 (FiveRuns fork)

* Fix set not handling client disconnects.
http://dev.twitter.com/2008/02/solving-case-of-missing-updates.html

= 1.5.0

* Add MemCache#flush_all command.  Patch #13019 and bug #10503.  Patches
  submitted by Sebastian Delmont and Rick Olson.
* Type-cast data returned by MemCache#stats.  Patch #10505 submitted by
  Sebastian Delmont.

= 1.4.0

* Fix bug #10371, #set does not check response for server errors.
  Submitted by Ben VandenBos.
* Fix bug #12450, set TCP_NODELAY socket option.  Patch by Chris
  McGrath.
* Fix bug #10704, missing #add method.  Patch by Jamie Macey.
* Fix bug #10371, handle socket EOF in cache_get.  Submitted by Ben
  VandenBos.

= 1.3.0

* Apply patch #6507, add stats command.  Submitted by Tyler Kovacs.
* Apply patch #6509, parallel implementation of #get_multi.  Submitted
  by Tyler Kovacs.
* Validate keys.  Disallow spaces in keys or keys that are too long.
* Perform more validation of server responses.  MemCache now reports
  errors if the socket was not in an expected state.  (Please file
  bugs if you find some.)
* Add #incr and #decr.
* Add raw argument to #set and #get to retrieve #incr and #decr
  values.
* Also put on MemCacheError when using Cache::get with block.
* memcache.rb no longer sets $TESTING to a true value if it was
  previously defined.  Bug #8213 by Matijs van Zuijlen.

= 1.2.1

* Fix bug #7048, MemCache#servers= referenced changed local variable.
  Submitted by Justin Dossey.
* Fix bug #7049, MemCache#initialize resets @buckets.  Submitted by
  Justin Dossey.
* Fix bug #6232, Make Cache::Get work with a block only when nil is
  returned.  Submitted by Jon Evans.
* Moved to the seattlerb project.

= 1.2.0

NOTE: This version will store keys in different places than previous
versions!  Be prepared for some thrashing while memcached sorts itself
out!

* Fixed multithreaded operations, bug 5994 and 5989.
  Thanks to Blaine Cook, Erik Hetzner, Elliot Smith, Dave Myron (and
  possibly others I have forgotten).
* Made memcached interoperable with other memcached libraries, bug
  4509.  Thanks to anonymous.
* Added get_multi to match Perl/etc APIs

= 1.1.0

* More Ruby-memcache compatibility
* More RDoc
* Switched to Hoe

= 1.0.0

Birthday!
