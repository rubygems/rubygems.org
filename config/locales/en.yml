      subtitle: what this is
      purpose:
        header: "Welcome to %{site}, the Ruby community's gem hosting service. The purpose of this project is three-fold:"
        better_api: Provide a better API for dealing with gems
        transparent_pages: Create more transparent and accessible project pages
        enable_community: Enable the community to improve and enhance the site
      founding: "The project was started in April 2009 by %{founder}, and has since grown to include the contributions of over %{contributors} and %{downloads}. As of the RubyGems 1.3.6 release, the site has been renamed to %{title} from Gemcutter to solidify the site's central role in the Ruby community."
      support: "Although Gemcutter is not run by one specific company, plenty have helped us out so far. The current design of the site was sponsored by %{thoughtbot}. %{github} has also been invaluable for helping us collaborate and share code easily. The site started on %{heroku}, whose great service helped prove Gemcutter as a viable solution that the whole community could rely on."
      technical: "Some insights into the technical aspects of the site: It's 100% Ruby. The main site is a %{rails} application, and the RubyGem serving is done through %{sinatra}. Gems are hosted on %{s3}, and the time between publishing a new gem and having it ready for installation is minimal. For more info, %{source_code}, which is %{license} over at GitHub."
