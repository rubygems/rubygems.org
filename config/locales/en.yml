  pages:
    about:
      founding_html: The project was started in April 2009 by %{founder}, and has since grown to include the contributions of over %{contributors} and %{downloads}. As of the RubyGems 1.3.6 release, the site has been renamed to %{title} from Gemcutter to solidify the site's central role in the Ruby community.
      support_html: Although RubyGems.org is not run by one specific company, plenty have helped us out so far. The current design, illustrations, and front-end development of this site were created by %{dockyard}. %{github} has also been invaluable for helping us collaborate and share code easily. The site started on %{heroku}, whose great service helped prove RubyGems as a viable solution that the whole community could rely on. Our infrastructure is currently hosted on %{aws}.
      technical_html: "Some insights into the technical aspects of the site: It's 100% Ruby. The main site is a %{rails} application. Gems are hosted on %{s3}, served by %{fastly}, and the time between publishing a new gem and having it ready for installation is usually just a few seconds. For more info, %{source_code}, which is %{license} over at GitHub."
